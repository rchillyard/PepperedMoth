</h3>
<p>The Peppered Moth Example is a biological example and utilizes a sex-based
evolutionary mechanism.
	The genome of the peppered moth is diploid in all organisms.
	The peppered moth illustrates a very fast adaptation to differing environmental
	conditions, and was noted and observed during before, during and after the
	early part of the industrial revolution in Britain.
	For more information see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_moth_evolution">Wikipedia.</a>
<br>
You can run the peppered moth example simply as an applet.  Simply click "Start" and watch the
moths breed and multiply (each moth is represented by a light or dark grey circle).
Now change the sootiness of the environment to a higher value.  Watch the ratio of dark
moths increase.  It may take several generations to react.
The options panel (click the left-most tab) allows you to change various settings.
You will only be able to change the formulas if you have the JEP (or equivalent) package available
in your classpath.
See <a href="../expressions/package.html">../expressions/package.html</a> for more details.
